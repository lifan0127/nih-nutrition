    "description": "This Roadmap was developed by the Interagency Committee on Human Nutrition Research (ICHNR) National Nutrition Research Roadmap (NNRR) Subcommittee, which included representatives from each of the participating ICHNR departments and agencies, 28 members in total. Sixteen members of the NNRR Subcommittee served on the NNRR Writing Group. The Roadmap identifies research priorities for human nutrition and describes the role of the ICHNR departments and agencies in addressing those priorities over the next five to ten years.",
